# H3D-assignment

You are given a directory containing JSON files. Your task is to build a small service that:
Watches an input folder for new .json files
Validates each file against a simple schema
Extracts a subset of fields
Writes the transformed output to a database or another output folder
Runs multiple workers in parallel
Logs processing results and errors
The goal is not perfection — we want clean code, reasonable architecture, and production-minded thinking.

Candidate Instructions
Requirements
Language: Python / Node / Java (your choice)
CLI or small service (no UI required)
Input: a folder path provided via argument or environment variable
Output: either
Write results into SQLite/Postgres, or
Write processed JSON into an output folder
Validation Rules
Each input JSON file must contain at minimum:

{
  "id": string,
  "timestamp": string (ISO-8601),
  "payload": object
}
Invalid files should:
not crash the service
be logged clearly as failures
Concurrency
Process files using multiple workers (threads, goroutines, async tasks, etc.)
Limit concurrency to avoid CPU thrashing (bounded pool)
Additional Expectations
Logging with timestamps and result summaries
Configurable paths and worker count via env or CLI flag
Graceful shutdown (finish processing in-flight files)
Unit tests for validation / transformation logic (not required for I/O)
